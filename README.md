# Iris Framework Tidy Basal Doccument

#### remark

* The greatest truths are the simplest. The world is a better place because of open source.

* Up to now, the official documents of iris framework have not been updated very fast, and many translation materials are not systematic enough. Some fragmentary translations are misleading. So try to systematize and supplement the notes and summaries of relevant materials to facilitate the recording, exchange and learning, and get started quickly.

* Note carding mainly considers the systematic carding of some knowledge focus and summary in iris framework, and is a long-term update. More analysis on the framework will be supplemented later. It is also hoped that the official documents will be updated as soon as possible.

* Some of iris's design ideas are very good, and will become a sharp tool for developers to develop quickly.

* Later, I will have time to supplement the specific implementation principles and details of the iris framework, and I welcome your discussion.

If you need, please feel free to contact me for discussion. Welcome to open source world.
