# iris Framework Tidy Basal Doccument

#### remark

The greatest truths are the simplest.  
The world is a better place because of open source.

* the official documents of the iris framework have not been updated too quickly, and many translated materials are not systematic enough. Some of the translations are superficial and misleading. As far as possible system comb relevant data notes convenient record review.
* note combing is mainly concerned with systematically combing some key points and summaries of knowledge in the iris framework for long-term updating.

* some of iris's minimalist design concepts are very good and will be a great tool for developers to develop quickly.

If you need to contact me at any time for discussion, welcome to join the open source world.
